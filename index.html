<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hi there, you have reached the personal web page of Florian Hahn.
</p>

<p>
Currently I am working as a compiler engineer at Apple on improving upstream
LLVM and Apple's compiler products. I am involved in a wide range of things, from
improving compile time and (Arm) code generation to loop and
interprocedural optimizations.
</p>


<p>
Before joining Apple, I worked as a software engineer at Arm's Manchester office
for 2.5 years. There I worked on upstream LLVM as well, focusing on
open-sourcing code from our commercial HPC compiler as well as support for Arm's
Scalable Vector Extension
</p>

<p>
Before moving to Manchester, I graduated from ETH ZÃ¼rich earning a Master's degree in Computer Science.
In 2014 I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Vienna University of Technology.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in compilers, programming languages, software verification and software engineering in general.
</p>

<p>In my spare time I try to contribute to open source projects big and small.</p>
