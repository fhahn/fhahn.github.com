<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hi there, you have reached the personal web page of Florian Hahn.
</p>

<p>
Currently I am working as a Graduate Software Engineer at ARM's Manchester office
on compilers and tools for ARM's next-generation HPC architectures.
</p>

<p>
Before moving to Manchester, I graduated from ETH Zürich earning a Master's degree in Computer Science.
In 2014 I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Vienna University of Technology.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in compilers, programming languages, software verification and software engineering in general.
</p>

<p>In my spare time I try to contribute to open source projects big and small.</p>
