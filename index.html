<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hi there, you have reached the personal web page of Florian Hahn.
</p>

<p>
I am a student at ETH Zürich earning a Master's degree in Computer Science.

In 2014 I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Vienna University of Technology.

I am interested in compilers, theoretical computer science, operating systems and software engineering in general.

<p>In my spare time I try to contribute to open source projects big and small.</p>
